# Bigfoot Case Study
> A case study of a design system for web development

## About

This is a project for the Web Development course at Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In this example, I dissect the [Bigfoot Music Management homepage](https://wearebigfoot.com), and then develop a simple component library from the study. I then rebuild the homepage with the components.
