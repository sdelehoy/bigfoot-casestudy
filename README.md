# Bigfoot Case Study
> A case study of a design system for web development

## About

This is a project for the Web Development course at Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In this example, I dissected the [Bigfoot Music Management homepage](https://wearebigfoot.com), and then developed a simple component library from the study. I then rebuilt the homepage with the components.
